## Deprecation of C++ SeedTool

This repo contains the original SeedTool written in C++, and is now deprecated. The [new SeedTool is written in Rust](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool-cli-rust) and is a complete rewrite. The new SeedTool's inputs and outputs are compatible with the old SeedTool, and most of the same command line options are supported. The new SeedTool is more flexible and extensible, and is designed to support additional functionality.

## Introduction

`seedtool` is a command-line tool for creating and transforming cryptographic seeds of the sort commonly used by blockchain applications.

It exercises the various cryptographic C libraries created by Blockchain Commons, as described in the Dependencies section.

## Status - Feature-Complete Beta

Seedtool is now considered feature-complete and is entering beta-level testing.

## Dependencies

Seedtool exercises the following Blockchain Commons libraries:

* [`bc-crypto-base`](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-crypto-base)
* [`bc-shamir`](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-shamir)
* [`bc-sskr`](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-sskr)
* [`bc-bip39`](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-bip39)
* [`bc-ur`](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-ur)

It also requires the following additional programs:

* [`GNU argp`](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Argp.html)
* [`CBOR Lite`](https://bitbucket.org/isode/cbor-lite)

### Tool Dependencies

To build `seedtool` you'll need to use the following tools:

- autotools - Gnu Build System from Free Software Foundation ([intro](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Autotools-Introduction.html)).

## Recommended Installation instructions

The dependencies will be automatically installed as submodules when you run the build script. This is the recommended way to install.

### Build with Docker

[Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and run:

```bash
# Build the image
$ docker build -t seedtool-cli .
# Run the container
$ docker run --rm -it seedtool-cli --help
```

### Build on MacOS

```bash
$ brew install autoconf automake libtool
```

You must then download or clone this repo. Afterward, cd into the repo directory and:

```bash
$ ./build.sh
$ sudo make install
```

### Build on Linux

Make sure you have `llvm`/`clang`, `libc++` and `libc++abi` installed, all with
a minimum recommended version 10.

#### Build on Ubuntu and Debian

```bash
$ sudo apt install build-essential

$ wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh
$ chmod +x llvm.sh
$ sudo apt install lsb-release wget software-properties-common
$ sudo ./llvm.sh 10  # version 10

$ sudo apt-get install libc++-10-dev libc++abi-10-dev
```

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install git
$ git clone https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool-cli.git
$ cd seedtool-cli/
$ export CC="clang-10" && export CXX="clang++-10" && ./build.sh
$ sudo make install
```

### Build on Windows

See [instructions here](Docs/Install-Windows.md).

## Alternative Installation Instructions

The following sequence does *not* install the dependencies from submodules; instead they must be installed in the usual places on the build system, otherwise the `./configure` step below will fail.

```bash
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
```
*Note:* On Linux the first step is `./configure CC=clang-10 CXX=clang++-10`

## Incremental Build Instructions

If you wish to make changes to the source code and rebuild:

```bash
# Make source changes
$ source set_build_paths.sh # sets shell variables used by make
$ make clean # If you want a clean build
$ make
```

## Usage Instructions

See [usage examples](Docs/Usage.md) for examples of using seedtool.

## Full Documentation

See [`MANUAL.md`](Docs/MANUAL.md) for details, many more examples, and version history.

## Notes for Maintainers

Before accepting a PR that can affect build or unit tests, make sure the following sequence of commands succeeds:

```bash
$ ./build.sh
$ make lint
$ make check
$ make distclean
```

`make lint` uses [Cppcheck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cppcheck) to perform static analysis on the code. All PRs should pass with no warnings.

* [LetheKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit) is a parallel project that uses many of the same libraries, but in hardware.
* [URKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/URKit) is another example of our [bc-ur](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur) universal-reference library.

We do ask that you offer us good faith and use best efforts not to leak information or harm any user, their data, or our developer community. Please give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before you publish it. Do not defraud our users or us in the process of discovery. We promise not to bring legal action against researchers who point out a problem provided they do their best to follow the these guidelines.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security vulnerabilities in private via email to ChristopherA@BlockchainCommons.com (do not use this email for support). Please do NOT create publicly viewable issues for suspected security vulnerabilities.

The following keys may be used to communicate sensitive information to developers:

| Name              | Fingerprint                                        |
